# 27/99 Prolog problems

[99 prolog problems](https://www.ic.unicamp.br/~meidanis/courses/mc336/2009s2/prolog/problemas/), written as pure & monotonic as I can.

## Why?

I read [the Power of Prolog](https://www.metalevel.at/prolog) and it blew my mind.
I knew about logic programming in general before, but this book is just choke full of prolog wisdom.
If you expect you're ever going to take prolog seriously, read it. Well worth the two days of headaches.

## To run this

Install [scryler-prolog](https://www.scryer.pl), and run:

```bash
scryer-prolog ./attempts/p${NUM}.pl
```

But [try it yourself]((https://www.ic.unicamp.br/~meidanis/courses/mc336/2009s2/prolog/problemas/)) first.
